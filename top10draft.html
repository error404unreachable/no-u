    <h1 align="center">My top 10 things I can't live without are:</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Badminton<br>Badminton is my absolute favorite sport. For me, nothing is even close to rivaling it. The 
fluid motions of the racket, the awe-inspiring feel of the birdie bouncing off the racket, 
but that’s not all. The requirements are good eye-to-hand coordination, good aim, and mostly skill. I mostly like to play casually, but a good competition is always fun. I first discovered badminton when I was closer to 6-7 years old. 
Our relatives were playing, and when I tried playing it, it became my favorite activity. For me, it was forget soccer, basketball or tennis. Badminton is more fun. I can’t say it’s not true. It will remain my favorite sport for a long time.

<li>Mountain biking<br>
I first tried mountain biking not that long ago, somewhere towards June or July. When I did, it was awesome.
The trails have interesting shapes, there’s multiple trail difficulties, and the best parts are either the stretches of straight ground to gain speed, the little hills which also give you more speed, or my favorite, the curves.
The curves give you speed, and if there are multiple in a row, the momentum lets you go sideways, almost defying gravity. There’s nothing better than a mountain bike ride.

<li>Trains<br>
From a young age, I’ve always been a fan of trains. I would watch a show, called Railroad in Australia, for hours on end. When I first got a train simulator, I couldn’t get enough of it.
Then I had a thought: Why not become a train engineer? So, now I’m driving for a Bachelor’s in Industrial Engineering so I can apply for a Locomotive Engineer position when I turn 21.
</li>
<li>Computer Programming<br>
When I first learned what programming was, I thought it was something cool and hard to learn, and was used for things like hacking. 
Well to your surprise, those are all true. Well, not exactly. 
It is considered ‘cool’ by people, and it is slightly hard to learn but mostly depends on the language. 
And for hacking, it’s used for ethical hacking. Now, many people will say “What’s the difference?”, and the difference is that ethical hacking is used for checking your own website for vulnerabilities.
A few of the languages I know are: HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), JS (Javascript), and Swift (simplified version of XCode).
These are really fun things, so I recommend you try them out!
(HTML5 = Beginner-friendly language, CSS3 = Intermediate, JS = Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced, Swift = Beginner/Intermediate)
