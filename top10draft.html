    <h1 align="center">My top 10 things I can't live without are:</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>Badminton<br>Badminton is my absolute favorite sport. For me, nothing is even close to rivaling it. The 
fluid motions of the racket, the awe-inspiring feel of the birdie bouncing off the racket, 
but that’s not all. The requirements are good eye-to-hand coordination, good aim, and mostly skill. I mostly like to play casually, but a good competition is always fun. I first discovered badminton when I was closer to 6-7 years old. 
Our relatives were playing, and when I tried playing it, it became my favorite activity. For me, it was forget soccer, basketball or tennis. Badminton is more fun. I can’t say it’s not true. It will remain my favorite sport for a long time.

<li>Mountain biking<br>
I first tried mountain biking not that long ago, somewhere towards June or July. When I did, it was awesome.
The trails have interesting shapes, there’s multiple trail difficulties, and the best parts are either the stretches of straight ground to gain speed, the little hills which also give you more speed, or my favorite, the curves.
The curves give you speed, and if there are multiple in a row, the momentum lets you go sideways, almost defying gravity. There’s nothing better than a mountain bike ride.

<li>Trains<br>
From a young age, I’ve always been a fan of trains. I would watch a show, called Railroad in Australia, for hours on end. When I first got a train simulator, I couldn’t get enough of it.
Then I had a thought: Why not become a train engineer? So, now I’m driving for a Bachelor’s in Industrial Engineering so I can apply for a Locomotive Engineer position when I turn 21.

<li>Computer Programming<br>
When I first learned what programming was, I thought it was something cool and hard to learn, and was used for things like hacking. 
Well to your surprise, those are all true. Well, not exactly. 
It is considered ‘cool’ by people, and it is slightly hard to learn but mostly depends on the language. 
And for hacking, it’s used for ethical hacking. Now, many people will say “What’s the difference?”, and the difference is that ethical hacking is used for checking your own website for vulnerabilities.
A few of the languages I know are: HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), JS (Javascript), and Swift (simplified version of XCode).
These are really fun things, so I recommend you try them out!
(HTML5 = Beginner-friendly language, CSS3 = Intermediate, JS = Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced, Swift = Beginner/Intermediate)

      <li>XBOX<br>
   If you’ve played XBOX before, you know that it’s the best console out there. It supports multiple games, it has high resolution graphics, and you can connect external storage to the XBOX. The games are contagiously fun, and some even support split-screen. Although you do need a game pass for some games, it’s still very fun. My favorite games are: Trackmania, Forza Horizon 5, Need for Speed Rivals, and Jurassic World Evolution 2.
   </li><br><br>
      <li>BBQ Pizza<br>
      When I first tried it, it was delicious. The delicious flavor of the BBQ sauce with the perfectly sliced chicken, and the gooey cheese on freshly baked bread. Sometimes, waiting for it to cool down,the smells rise up into my nose. iIt smells too good to be true, yet there it is, on the plate in front of me. It’s my favorite food.
</li><br><br>
      <li>Cars<br>
      I love cars. The interesting designs of the body. The roar of the engine. How the engine works. It’s all fascinating to me. My favorite video games have cars. I can’t live without them. My favorite is the Koenigsegg Jesko by Koenigsegg Automotive. The car I’m mostly likely to get is the Ford Mustang.
</li><br><br>
      <li>Video Games<br>
       Video games are really fun. My favorite mobile game is Geometry Dash, and my favorite console game is Trackmania. Both are really fun, and require lots of skill and eye-to-hand coordination. In both of them you can build levels (Only in GD Full which costs $2, but you can still get Lite, Subzero, Meltdown, and World which are all free), and have really good graphics. They are really fun so I recommend you play them!
</li><br><br.
      <li>Family<br>
I can’t live without my family. Although two sisters can get very annoying and frustrating, I still can’t live without them. My mom and dad are the best. They take us on road trips to many places, and we have lots of fun. There’s nothing better than family, especially a day of tennis with them.
</li><br>
  <li>Duluth<br>
  I can’t live without going to Duluth. It has a train museum, my personal favorite, and much more. It has lots of beaches and scenic sites there, including: Split Rock Lighthouse, Black Sand Beach, trails, and attraction sites. If you’ve never been to Duluth, you're missing out. It’s very fun!
